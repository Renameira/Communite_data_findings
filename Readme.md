## Bike Sharing System Data Exploration and Visualization
by Renato Meira


### Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.Note that this dataset will require some data wrangling in order to make it tidy for analysis.


### Investigation Overview

Bay Wheels is a regional public bicycle sharing system in California's San Francisco Bay Area. It is operated by Motivate in a partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. Bay Wheels is 'the first regional and large-scale bicycle sharing system deployed in California and on the West Coast of the United States. It was established as Bay Area Bike Share in August 2013. As of January 2018, the Bay Wheels system had over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose.
In June 2017 the system was officially re-launched as Ford GoBike in a partnership with Ford Motor Company. After Motivate's acquisition by Lyft, the system was renamed to Bay Wheels in June 2019. The system is expected to expand to 7,000 bicycles around 540 stations in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville, and San Jose.


### Summary of Findings

Most subscribers were male and we observed that the age distribution will have a reliable range between 21 and 56 years. We can also see that trips usually take place on Tuesday and Thursday more frequently.
Using the age distribution, we evaluated that the use of the bicycle sharing service is lower for older ages.

We can note that the frequency of trip duration is much lower among subscribers and casual pilots. I believe there is a different goal between the profiles, maybe the subscriber has a goal of getting around, for example from work to home,
while the casual rider seems to take the rides for entertainment.

In this chart, we assess the average time between customers and subscribers, and we can see that there is a different behavior between the two groups.
The use of customers is longer and Subscribers travel an average of 10 minutes, showing that the system proposal is for both groups.

As shown in the heat map above, we can verify that the behavior between the two groups is totally different, as previously positioned. The proposal of using the complete system is the most acidic use on the weekend for customer and the commuting of the Subscriber, perhaps between work and home.

### Key Insights for Presentation

From the exploration, we can ascertain the behavior of using the service for users discriminated as customer and subscriber. We can see from the proposed analysis that customers use the sharing system for entertainment and leisure, as it provides greater use on weekends and average travel time, while the subscriber uses it to get around more often for a week, usually for displacement, example home to work, gym to home, among others.

We were able to conclude that the age that most uses the bike sharing service (Using Confidence Interval) is between 21 and 56 years old.
We can also assess that the days of weeks that are most used are Tuesday and Thursday.
Finally, we can achieve that, the sharing system is efficient for both users who want to move to leisure.
